# HideInventoryClutter

A libFilter3 based addon that adds a toggle to display/hide two categories of items from your inventory (as well as  depositing items to (house) bank, sending mails and selling to merchant):

# locked items 

Most players cary multiple gear sets in their inventories, and obviously, they are aware of the fact. This addon removes visual clutter from player's inventory by toggling visibility of all locked items with 1 button click. (This filter is applied by default to mail and merchant menu, even turning it off will not allow you to sell or mail locked items.)

# consumables

Items that everyone carries at all times, seeing them is unnecessary unless restocking or selling excess amounts. Toggle applies to:

- Lockpick
- Grand Repair Kit
- Soul Gem

- buff food and drinks
- potions
- poisons

# Usage

To move icons to the desired location on your screen use the following command, move them and use the command again.

`/hideinventorycluttertogglemoveicons`

# Known bugs

Filters are currently being applied to (house) bank withdrawal panel. This is unintentional and hopefully (it's more related to LibFilters and ESO itself than my addon) will be fixed in the future, sorry for the inconvienience. If you want to withdraw locked/consumable items, you need to toggle the filter first.
