# HideInventoryClutter

A libFilter3 based addon that adds a toggle to display/hide locked items in player's inventory. Most players cary multiple gear sets in their inventories, and obviously, they are aware of the fact. This addon removes visual clutter from player inventory by hiding all locked items.

Additionally, there's some filters that hide different items based on different conditions, but as of now they're disabled. I will consider adding a proper support for that use case in the future, as of now you have to edit addon's code to get them to work.
