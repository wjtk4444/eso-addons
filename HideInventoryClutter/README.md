# HideInventoryClutter

A libFilter3 based addon that adds a toggle to display/hide two categories of items from your inventory (as well as  depositing items to (house) bank, sending mails, deconstructing or selling items to merchant):

# locked items 

Most players cary multiple gear sets in their inventories, and obviously, they are aware of the fact. This addon removes visual clutter from player's inventory by toggling visibility of all locked items with 1 button click. (This filter is applied by default to mail and merchant menu, even turning it off will not allow you to sell or mail locked items.)

# consumables

Items that everyone carries at all times, seeing them is unnecessary unless restocking or selling excess amounts. Toggle applies to:

- Lockpick
- Grand Repair Kit
- Soul Gem

- buff food and drinks
- potions
- poisons

# items "worth" deconstructing

By default you'll only see items that meet the following criteria at a deconstruction panel. You can toggle the remaining items with the lock button.

- Green and above jewelry
- Purple and above weapons and armor
- Non player-made glyphs (noone wants to deconstruct their freshly made glyphs by accident)

Remaining items are usually better off sold to a merchant (depends on the style material price, which this addon currently disregards). I highly recommend [DoItAll](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info690-DoItAllMassExtractDeconstructMoveMailattach....html) to deconstruct items in one click. For use with caution ;)

# items "worth" selling

By default you'll only see items that meet the following criteria in the vendor panel. You can toggle the remaining items with the lock button.

- Items that are worth deconstructing (see above)
- crafting materials

# Usage

To move icons to the desired location on your screen go to addon settings and unlock button positions, move them around and lock them again to save new position.
