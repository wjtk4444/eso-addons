# HideInventoryClutter

A libFilter3 based addon that adds a toggle to display/hide two categories of items:

# locked items 

Most players cary multiple gear sets in their inventories, and obviously, they are aware of the fact. This addon removes visual clutter from player's inventory by toggling visibility of all locked items with 1 button click.

# consumables

Items that everyone carries at all times, seeing them is unnecessary unless restocking or selling excess amounts. Toggle applies to:

- Lockpick
- Grand Repair Kit
- Soul Gem

- buff food and drinks
- potions
- poisons
