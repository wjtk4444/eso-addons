# Schrodi's Housing Tools

Small quality-of-life fixes for the keyboard housing editor and the Furniture Vault.

## Housing editor

**Sortable Retrieve list.** The Retrieve tab gets *Name* and *Distance* column headers. Click a header to sort by it; click again to reverse the order. The default is *Distance*, nearest first, the same as the game. Your choice is remembered.

**"Retrieve To" next to the list.** The game shows the *Retrieve To* bag selector in a separate box in the top-left corner of the screen. This addon moves it into the footer of the Retrieve list, where the "Bag: x/y" line used to be. The bag list opens upwards.

**Right-click to store** *(off by default)*. With this checkbox on, right-clicking a furnishing in the Retrieve list puts it away into the *Retrieve To* bag. Path nodes are ignored. The checkbox sits next to the filter dropdown above the list.

**Bound items to Vault** *(off by default)*. Bound furnishings always go to the Furnishing Vault when you put them away, whatever bag is selected. Everything else still goes to the selected bag. This works for every way of putting furniture away: the list, right-click, and the keybind in the world (keyboard and gamepad). It does nothing if the Furnishing Vault is not available (it needs ESO+ and the vault collectible).

**Smarter category jumps.** When you place or retrieve the last item in a category, the game jumps back to the first category in the list. With this addon it moves to the next non-empty category instead, or to the previous one if there is no next one. This applies to the Place and Retrieve tabs. The Crown Store tab is left alone.

## Furniture Vault

Both the **Withdraw** and **Deposit** panels of the Furniture Vault get the same filter dropdown as the housing editor:

- **Bound state:** Bound / Unbound
- **Furnishing limit type:** the four placement limit groups (traditional furnishings, special furnishings, collectible furnishings, special collectibles)

The dropdown is created by the game's own housing editor code, so the options and their names are the same. Filters reset when you reload the UI, as in the housing editor.

## Settings

There is no settings menu. The two checkboxes in the housing editor and the sort order are saved account-wide.

## Upgrading from HousingRetrieveSort / FurnitureVaultFilters

This addon replaces both of them. Disable or delete the old ones. If either is still enabled, its part of this addon is turned off and you get a reminder in chat.

Settings are not carried over. Set the sort order and the two checkboxes again once.

## Known limitations

- Keyboard UI only (except for *Bound items to Vault*, which also works on gamepad).
- With *Bound items to Vault* on, the in-world keybind label still says "Put Away to <selected bag>" for bound furnishings, even though they go to the vault.
