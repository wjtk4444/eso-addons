# Ultimate Regen Timer

In combat you only generate ultimate passively for **8 seconds** after one of these:

- your light or heavy attack hits,
- you block an attack,
- you dodge an attack.

If you only cast skills (for example as a healer or tank that never weaves light attacks), the window runs out and ultimate generation stops. This addon shows the seconds left, by default right between your last skill and your ultimate button, where your eyes already are.

<!-- screenshot: action bar with the timer between slot 5 and the ultimate -->

The number turns a warning color at 0, so you see right away that you need to weave a light attack.

## Settings

*Settings → Addons → Ultimate Regen Timer*

- **Show outside of combat:** when off, the timer disappears once it reaches 0 out of combat.
- **Size**, **Color**, **Color at 0**, **Outline**.
- **Unlock to move** (or `/urt`): the timer stays unlocked after you close the menu, so you can line it up with your action bar. Switch to cursor mode, drag the number, then lock it again in the settings or with `/urt`. **Reset position** puts it back between the last skill and the ultimate.

The timer is only shown on the HUD, like the action bar.

## Upgrading from UltimateRetarded

This is the same addon under a new name, with settings. Delete the old `UltimateRetarded` folder. The old position is not carried over; the new default position sits next to the ultimate button.

## Requirements

- LibAddonMenu-2.0
