# eso-addons
A collection of various addons for The Elder Scrolls Online game.
Open addon directory to see its readme file.

## Installation (same for all addons, choose one method)

- Install using [Minion](https://www.minion.gg/). Addon names are the same as subdirectory names in this repository.

- Download addons from [esoui website](https://www.esoui.com/) and extract them to your \
`C:/users/<your username>/Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/` \
directory. If the directory does not exist, create it. Technically, you can also download them from here, but I cannot guarantee that the last commit on master branch will always work as expected (or at all). Maybe I'll add working zips to github releases at some point, maybe I will not.
